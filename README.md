# NewYorkCitySubwayStatus
This project is an alexa skill that checks the NYC Subway status. 

This skill uses the all-new GTFS feed to capture every delays and service alerts that MTA posted, planned or unplanned. While some of the other skills stopped updating since October, this skill uses the newest GTFS format to get information directly from the MTA server. In other words, the alerts will be in-sync with what you would see on the MTA website at the moment.
